# Sprocket Sentinel

Welcome to sprocket-sentinel, a toy compiler in c++ built for a toy language.



## Setup instructions

To setup this compiler, go to (*preferably a Linux system*) and clone this repository by:

``````bash
git clone https://github.com/buttafraz22/sprocket-sentinel/
``````



Next, compile the complete.cpp file by:

``````bash
g++ -o comp version-3.cpp
``````



Run the provided sample code.skibidi by:

`````bash
./complete code.skibidi
./code
`````



## About Skibidi-LANG

Skibidi-lang is a simple, toy language that uses the minimalist of the grammars required to fully build and execute a compiler. The keywords of this language appeal to the GenZ nature of this language.

* Variable types: int, str (string), dbl (double)
* Declaration and independent assignments both allowed
* Compound expressions (those having &&, ||, !=, ==, <=, >=) are allowed as part of expressions.
* The structure of `if` is `if (expression) {}`.
* Declare functions using `vibe`. Function declarations are similar to c++. `vibe functionName(variableType id, ...) {}`.
* Loop Keywords:(`til` (while)/ `fore`(for)). The syntax of these loops is similar to what you'll find in c++. 
* Return things using the keyword `sending`.
* Who can forget what Gen-Z LOVE the most? Yap your heart out using the keyword `yap`.
